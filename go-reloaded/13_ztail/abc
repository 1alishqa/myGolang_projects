    Write a function that simulates the behaviour of the Atoi function in Go. Atoi transforms a number represented as a string in a number represented as an int.

    Atoi returns 0 if the string is not considered as a valid number. For this exercise non-valid string chains will be tested. Some will contain non-digits characters.

    For this exercise the handling of the signs + or - does have to be taken into account.

    This function will only have to return the int. For this exercise the error result of atoi is not required.
