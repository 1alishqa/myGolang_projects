The tail command can also monitor data streams and open files,
displaying new information as it is written. For example, 
it's a useful way to monitor the newest events in a system log in real time.

By default, tail prints the last 10 lines of each file to standard output. 
If you specify more than one file, 
each set of output is prefixed with a header showing the file name.

Keep trying to open a file even if it is temporarily inaccessible; 
useful with the --follow=name option.

Outputs the last 10 lines of myfile.txt, 
and monitors myfile.txt for updates; 
tail then continues to output any new lines that are added to myfile.txt.
